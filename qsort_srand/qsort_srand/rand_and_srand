rand() - create the same sequence of random number again and again every time program runs.

srand() function sets the starting point for producing a series of pseudo-random integers. If srand() is not called, the rand() seed is set as if srand(1) were called at program start. Any other value for seed sets the generator to a different starting point.

Syntax:   void srand( unsigned seed )
Seeds the pseudo-random number generator used by rand()
with the value seed.
Note: The pseudo-random number generator should only be seeded once, before any calls to rand(), and the start of the program. It should not be repeatedly seeded, or reseeded every time you wish to generate a new batch of pseudo-random numbers.
    Standard practice is to use the result of a call to srand(time(0)) as the seed. However, time() returns a time_t value which vary everytime and hence the pseudo-random number vary for every program call.
