Standard C library provides qsort() that can be used for sorting an array.

void qsort (void* base, size_t num, size_t size,int (*comparator)(const void*,const void*));

int comparator(const void* p1, const void* p2);
Return value meaning
<0 The element pointed by p1 goes before the element pointed by p2
0  The element pointed by p1 is equivalent to the element pointed by p2
>0 The element pointed by p1 goes after the element pointed by p2
