Method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not
Convert Big endian to little endian
HashTable
Nth_fibonacci_num
An image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees in place
Queue_using_linkedlist
Remove_Duplicates_In_String
Replace_0_MxN_matrix
Replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’
Encode bits in a 32-bit number such that, most significant 16 bits should be reversed but lower 16 bits should be untouched. Generalize this to any number of bits
Reverse_String
Stack_using_linkedlist
A function that returns an array of the first five primes, that would be 2,3,5,7,11. Have the main function display those values.
abbreviate_first_char
angle_between_clockhands
Create a function that modifies a character array or string - convert all the letter to uppercase and change all the spaces to underlines
array_3stack
binary_tree_implementation
bit_macros
Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e.g., M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j).
Given a (decimal - e.g. 3.72) number that is passed in as a string, print the binary representation. If the number can not be represented accurately in binary, print “ERROR”
Write a function to determine the number of bits required to convert integer A to integer B
Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (i.e., “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”)
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop
Given an integer, print the next smallest and next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.
